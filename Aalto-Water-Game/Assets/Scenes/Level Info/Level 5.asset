  LevelHint: Wonderful! The world has an environmental capacity (point system) for
    placing structures. Strategically place structures to turn tiles green before
    exhausting the environmental capacity. Each desalinator costs -30 points, each
    sprinkler costs -10 points, and each reservoir costs -20 points. Use the buildings
    to convert 25 tiles to grass.
